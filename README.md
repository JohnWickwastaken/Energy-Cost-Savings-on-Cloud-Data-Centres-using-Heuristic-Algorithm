# Energy Cost Savings on Cloud Data Centres using Heuristic Algorithm
 
Cloud computing has become the front face of various development of cloud data centres around the world as it is all in a shared space called the Internet. Cost savings for consumers and broader extensibility of access are some of the provisions offered. Due to the consumption of energy consumed by the cloud data centres, there has been an insignificant resource allocation and migration of virtual machines. This research paper compares various energy aware algorithms and proposes that an optimized or improved Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm would be the best fit resulting in more than 23% savings. The algorithm shifts around VMs based on the workload and places them in the decreasing order of priority. Literature review shows that the PSO, HSA or combined use of these algorithms results slightly better in higher efficiency and low power consumption.
