# Energy Cost Savings on Cloud Data Centres using Heuristic Algorithm
 
Cloud computing has become the front face of various developments of cloud data centres around the world as it is all in a shared space called the Internet. Some of the provisions offered are cost savings for consumers and broader extensibility of access. Due to the energy consumed by the cloud data centres, there has been an insignificant resource allocation and migration of virtual machines. This research paper compares various energy-aware algorithms and proposes that an optimised or improved Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm would be the best fit, resulting in more than 23% savings. The algorithm shifts around VMs based on the workload and places them in decreasing order of priority. A literature review shows that the PSO, HSA, or combined use of these algorithms results in slightly higher efficiency and lower power consumption. This research also includes the comparison and accuracy metrics done on K-Means++,PSO,PSO Hybrid, and HSA.
